# SSI Website

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Installation

First, install [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and the [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) and [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) extensions.

Then, install [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

Clone this repository and open it in VSCode.

Then install the dependencies:

```bash
yarn install
```

Then, create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and add all of the environment variables listed in `.env.example`. You can get the values for these variables from the SSI team.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `src/pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
